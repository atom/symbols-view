# Symbols View package

Display the list of functions/methods in the editor via `cmd-r` in Atom.

If your project has a `tags`/`TAGS` file at the root then following are
supported:

  * `cmd-shift-r` to view all function/methods in the project

  * `ctrl-alt-down` to jump to the declaration of the method/function under
    the cursor

This package uses [ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net).
